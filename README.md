## API Load Test
A load test is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under a specific workload or “load.” The primary goal of load testing is to determine the system’s ability to handle anticipated user traffic, transactions, or data volumes within acceptable performance criteria. Here are the key aspects of load testing:
1. Workload Simulation.
2. Performance Metrics.
3. Scalability Assessment.
4. Identifying Bottlenecks.
5. Stress Testing.
